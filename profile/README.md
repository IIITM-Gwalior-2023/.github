#CodeHub - 2023
##A community by the freshers for the freshers

Join the ABV IIITM CodeHub, an organisation created by the freshers for the freshers. Here, you can share your projects, collaborate with your peers, learn and upskill. This will also go a long way in helping you in the industry as most tech companies use one form or the other of Git as their underlying Version Control System (VCS).

#Instructions to join:
1. Post your GitHub username in the CodeKitchen group on WhatsApp.
2. An invitation will be sent to the email associated with your GitHub profile, you can then join the organisation.

#Guidelines:
1. Constructive criticism and collaboration is always welcome but one should never shame another's work or views.
2. Respect licenses and attribute other's work wherever needed. Plagiarism will not be tolerated
3. Do not spam the organisation with useless repositories, try to make a proof of concept or minimal version of your idea and only then post it to the organisation.
